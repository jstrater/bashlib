bashlib
=======

A collection of Bash functions I've found useful. They're separated into different files under `lib/` to facilitate picking & choosing, or you can get all of them at once by sourcing `bashlib.sh`. To do that, clone this repository and add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
. /path/to/bashlib/bashlib.sh
```
